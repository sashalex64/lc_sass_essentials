# Sass Essential Training
I used gulp-sass and gulp-connect (as a server) instead of ruby sass and gulp-webserver. File structure is also slightly changed.

## Instructions


1. Make sure you have these installed
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
	- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
